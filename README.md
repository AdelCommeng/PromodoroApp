# PromodoroApp
An exciting project that imitates the Promodoro technique! Using built in Tkinter module
The Promodoro technique is an effective way to time manage and increase one's productivity:
Set a timer for 25 min to work on something, and  then take a short 5 min break. That's one "Promodoro". 
After doing four Promodoras, take a long 20 min break.
